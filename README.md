In this Directory, you can find the WASP-A (animals) and WASP-B (plants) species lists. Note that these are only lists of species without perception rating.
The WASP database contains these species and is currently collecting data at: http://wasp-project.net/survey.
We are expecting to be able to publish the WASP database by February 2025.

The R code used to produce the WASP paper (https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baad003/) is available upon request.
